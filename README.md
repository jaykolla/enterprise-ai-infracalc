# Enterprise AI InfraCalc

A browser-based infrastructure planning calculator for GenAI workloads — GPU sizing, total cost of ownership, unit economics, and an AI assistant. No backend required; runs entirely client-side and deploys to Netlify as a single HTML file.

**Live demo:** https://eaidemo.netlify.app

## What it does

| Module | Description |
|---|---|
| **GenAI GPU Sizing** | Estimates GPU count, memory footprint, throughput, and latency for LLM inference deployments |
| **TCO Calculator** | Compares on-premises vs cloud IaaS total cost of ownership with break-even analysis |
| **Unit Economics** | Computes $/GPU-hour and $/1M tokens for both deployment options |
| **Sensitivity Analysis** | Models impact of power cost changes and GPU utilization on unit economics |
| **Formulas & Assumptions** | Step-by-step reference guide for all 27 calculation formulas |
| **AI Assistant** | Embedded chatbot that explains calculator results using your live numbers |

## Key features

- **Multi-turn conversation depth modeling** — KV cache sizing accounts for context accumulation across conversation turns, not just single-turn estimates
- **Hardware comparison mode** — side-by-side GPU sizing across AMD MI300X / MI325X / MI350X and NVIDIA H100 / H200
- **Workload presets** — Customer Chatbot, Code Assistant, RAG/Document QA, Batch Summarization
- **Export** — PDF (browser print), JSON download, shareable URL with state encoded in query params
- **Dark / light theme**
- **Mobile responsive**

## Running locally

No build step — just open the file:

```bash
open netlify_deploy/index.html
```

Or serve it with any static server:

```bash
npx serve netlify_deploy
```

## Enabling the AI Assistant

The AI Assistant runs entirely client-side and needs no backend, but it is gated and requires your own API key. To get the chat working:

1. **Open the AI Assistant** panel from the sidebar.
2. **Enter the access code** at the "Access Code Required" gate and click **Unlock Chat**. The code is `INFRACALC`. Your unlock is remembered in the browser (`localStorage`), so you only do this once per browser.
3. **Get a free Cerebras API key** — sign up at [cerebras.ai](https://cerebras.ai) and create a key. It starts with `csk-`.
4. **Paste the key** into the API-key field in the chat. It is stored only in your browser's `localStorage` (`or_user_key`) and sent directly to Cerebras — it never touches a server of ours.
5. **Start chatting.** Requests go to `https://api.cerebras.ai/v1/chat/completions` using the `gpt-oss-120b` model.

**Notes**
- The key lives only in your browser. Clearing site data or using a different browser/device requires re-entering it.
- If you hit a rate limit or a 401, the assistant will prompt you to re-enter a valid key.
- The assistant is an explainer for the calculator's results and methodology — not a general-purpose chatbot.
